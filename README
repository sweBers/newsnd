This mod uses the sounds provided by Inger in the Ingar soundpack and some of 
the minetest_game code to replace some of the default sounds.  Note, I cannot 
determine which sounds were new and which ones were old, so all sounds provided
by Ingar were moved to this mod.

Please feel free to provided updated sounds.  This mod is only to connect the 
sound to the game.
